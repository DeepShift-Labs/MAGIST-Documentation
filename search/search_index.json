Official Documentation We now have official documentation available here ! Working Principle Data The data is the most crucial element as the entire intelligence works around it. That is why it is important for the AI to process it and provide reasonable assumptions. There is another condition, however: the algorithm, in its finished state, MUST be strictly Python code. This means no pre-trained models or presets. It must find its data and process it unsupervised. Although this architecture seems hard-coded in the present state, as more functionality is added, it will be more intelligent and decisive. Here, the data will assume the following structure: Object -> Common Associated Verbs, Synonyms, Events, Timestamps of usage, Nearby Objects, etc. This is the \"Who, What, When, Where, Why, How\" of the data. This data can later be filtered and called upon when inferences are needed. To get here, however, the data must first be extracted from a single image. Since no pre-trained models are allowed, here is the process to follow: 1. K-Means Clustering(find key objects in the image) -> Discriminator for integrity check(see if clustering was performed well) 2. Reverse Image Search and Google Scraping(find the label of image) -> Data Downloader(find dataset from large datasets) 3. Transfer Learn Model -> Object Detector 4. Get a summary from internet sources like Wikipedia; location from LiDAR(future); user from facial detection(future); etc. 5. Store all the data in the NeuralDB Natural Language Processing Another key stage of this AGI(Artificial General Intelligence) is human interaction and understanding. MAGIST will constantly listen to conversations and make intelligent decisions. Here is the target process: 1. Record audio data and transcribe it(this is ***the only*** place where a pre-trained model(the transcriber) is used since learning a human language fully unsupervised is incredibly arduous. 2. Use a custom positional embedding with a Self-Attention head to find keywords. 3. Search these terms in the NeuralDB for possible entries. 4. Search unknown terms online and store definitions for future reference. (future) 5. Extract key terms from matching entries. (future) 6. Insert those key terms into a text transformer trained on the collected NeuralDB data to generate a prediction. (future) 7. Utter the prediction. (future) Usage This project is still under development. Please contact me at krishna.shah@deepshift.dev if you want immediate access and/or support to MAGIST. Once the algorithm is in a stable state, I will release a Python Package on PyPI and Github for access. There will also be documentation with more instructions. Installation This project has many dependencies. Most can be installed using pip . Some require OS-level package managers. This is going to work best in Linux-based systems. These instructions are for Linux-based systems. In particular for Ubuntu 20.04 LTS based operating systems. Other systems may have errors that will require debugging. Linux (Ubuntu-based Systems) First, install Python 3 and pip : sudo apt install python3 python3-dev python3-pip Next, we need to install Firefox and its corresponding geckodriver for headless Selenium searches: sudo apt install firefox Note: If you get an error regarding the geckodriver, you can install it manually by following the instructions here .

The data is processed, in turn, slowly extracting meaning from it. This contradicts most modern powerful AI models that use a single, massive network. Some examples include GPT-3, BERT, Imagen, etc. This limits the functionality of the AI, in terms of AGIs, since human-procured data has to be fed to it. This data is sorted and assessed with a fine-toothed comb and removes the stochasticity the environment contains. This also reduces its ability to teach itself new tasks. Despite being multi-purpose, it is functionally limited. That is why MAGIST uses a multi-agent, self-supervised approach.

K-Means Clustering aims to divide a given sample data into \"k\" groups. The process is intuitively simple: Place k number centroids of the clusters in random locations in the data space. For each sample in the data space, associate its class with the nearest centroid. For each cluster, compute the geometric center and move the centroids there. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until you don't need to change the location of the centroid. Automatically compute \"k\" There is a way to find the number of clusters(k) you need. This technique utilizes the elbow curve that is generated by creating a line graph of the number of clusters \"k\" and the corresponding reduction in variation. This is not currently implemented in MAGIST, but there are plans to implement it soon. 1 1 Implementation Using MAGIST Currently, MAGIST uses K-Means Clustering for masking images. It attempts to identify individual objects in an image which can then be further processed to extract more information. For this, you must use the UnsupervisedModels under the Vision directory. It can be imported like so: from MAGIST.Vision.UnsupervisedModels.img_cluster import RoughCluster # (1) UnsupervisedModels contains a Python file named img_cluster.py that contains the RoughCluster class. This is where all the necessary methods for computing the clusters. Note This computation is done with the help of SciKit-Learn and Pandas. Now, create an instance of the RoughCluster class: clusterer = RoughCluster ( \"PATH/TO/CONFIG.json\" ) # (1) More information about the config file is located here: Setup Config File Finally, we can compute the cluster: n_of_clusters = 3 img_location = \"Data/test.jpg\" img_size = ( 200 , 200 ) masked_img_dir = \"Data/Clusters\" masked_img_locations = clusterer . unsupervised_clusters ( n_of_clusters , img_location , img_size , masked_img_dir ) Here is what masked_img_locations should look like: [ \"Data/Clusters/masked0.jpg\" , \"Data/Clusters/masked1.jpg\" , \"Data/Clusters/masked2.jpg\" ] # (1) The amount of images listed depends on the n_of_clusters . These images are the final masked results. Through the config file, you can enable verbose to see the intermediate stage before it individually exporting the images.

It can be imported like so: from MAGIST.Vision.UnsupervisedModels.img_cluster import RoughCluster # (1) UnsupervisedModels contains a Python file named img_cluster.py that contains the RoughCluster class. This is where all the necessary methods for computing the clusters. Note This computation is done with the help of SciKit-Learn and Pandas. Now, create an instance of the RoughCluster class: clusterer = RoughCluster ( \"PATH/TO/CONFIG.json\" ) # (1) More information about the config file is located here: Setup Config File Finally, we can compute the cluster: n_of_clusters = 3 img_location = \"Data/test.jpg\" img_size = ( 200 , 200 ) masked_img_dir = \"Data/Clusters\" masked_img_locations = clusterer . unsupervised_clusters ( n_of_clusters , img_location , img_size , masked_img_dir ) Here is what masked_img_locations should look like: [ \"Data/Clusters/masked0.jpg\" , \"Data/Clusters/masked1.jpg\" , \"Data/Clusters/masked2.jpg\" ] # (1) The amount of images listed depends on the n_of_clusters . These images are the final masked results. Through the config file, you can enable verbose to see the intermediate stage before it individually exporting the images. These images were acquired from WikiPedia . \u21a9 \u21a9","title":"Implementation Using MAGIST"},{"location":"MAGIST%20Vision/3%20-%20Detection%20Data%20Management/","text":"Detection Data Management
