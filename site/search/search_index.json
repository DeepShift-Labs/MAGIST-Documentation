Working Principal Here is a flow diagram with the entire system drawn here . Data The data is the most important element as the entire intelligence works around it. That is why it is important for the AI to process it and provide reasonable assumptions. There is another condition however: the algorithm, in its finished state, MUST be strictly Python code. This means no pretrained models or presets. It must find its own data and process it unsupervised. This structure is called a \"semi-supervised\" structure. Here, the data wil assume the following structure: Object -> Common Associated Verbs, Synonyms, Events, Timestamps of usage, Nearby Objects, etc. This is the \"Who, What, When, Where, Why, How\" of the data. This data can later be filtered and called apon when inferences are needed. To get here, however, the data must first be extacted from a single image. Since no pretrained models are allowed, here is the process to follow: 1. K-Means Clustering(find key objects in image) -> Discriminator for integrity check(see if clustering was performed well) 2. Reverse Image Search and Google Scraping(find label of image) -> Data Downloader(find dataset from large datasets) 3. Transfer Learn Model -> Object Detector 4.

Store all the data in the NeuralDB Natural Language Processing Another key stage of this AGI(Artificial General Intelligence) is the huaman interaction and understanding. MAGIST will constantly listen to conversations and make intelligent decisions. Here is the target process: 1.

Once the algorithm is in a stable state, I will release a Python Package on PYPI and Github for access. There will also be documentation with more instructions. Installation This project has many dependencies. Most can be installed using pip . Some require OS-level package managers. This is going to work best in Linux-based systems. These instruction are for Linux-based systems. In particular for Ubuntu 20.04 LTS based operating systems. Other systems may have errors that will require debugging. Linux (Ubuntu-based Systems) First install Python 3 and pip : sudo apt install python3 python3-dev python3-pip Next, we need to install Firefox and its corresponding geckodriver for headless Selenium searches: sudo apt install firefox Note: If you get an error regarding the geckodriver, you can install it manually by following the instructions here . Install System Packages Next, we need to install the system packages that MAGIST uses. sudo apt install python3-pyaudio sudo apt install libasound-dev MongoDB Next, we need to install MongoDB. This is a database that MAGIST uses to store its data. Please go to the MongoDB Website and follow the instructions to install it. We have more instructions in the documentation . Next, create a Python environment. There are 2 ways to do this: Anaconda or VEnv. Anaconda First install Anaconda from https://www.anaconda.com/.

In fact, if humans believe hard enough, it is possible to influence this computation and see a different reality. With MAGIST, I have took a similar approach. The data is processed, in turn, slowly extracting meaning from it. This contradicts with most modern powerful AI models who use a single, massive network. Some examples include: GPT-3, BERT, Imagen, etc. This limits the functionality of the AI, in terms of AGIs, since human-procured data has to be fed to it. This data is sorted and assesed with a fine-toothed comb and removes the stochasity the environment contains. This also reduces its ability to teach itself new tasks. Despite being multi-functionaly, it is functionaly limited. That is why MAGIST uses a multi-agent, self-supervised approach.

K-Means Clustering aims to divide a given sample data into \"k\" groups. The process is intuitivly simple: Place k number centroids of the clusters in random locations in the data space. For each sample in the data space, associate its class with the nearest centroid. For each cluster, compute the geometric center and move the centroids there. Repeat step 2 and 3 until you don't need to change the location of the centroid. Automatically compute \"k\" There is a way to find the number of clusters(k) you need. This technique utilizes the elbow curve that is generated by creating a line graph of the number of clusters \"k\" and the corresponding reduction in variation. This is not currently implemented in MAGIST, but there are plans to implement it soon. 1 1 Implementation Using MAGIST Currently, MAGIST uses K-Means Clustering for masking images. It attempts to identify individual objects in an image which can then be further processed to extract more information. For this, you must use the UnsupervisedModels under the Vision directory. It can be imported like so: from MAGIST.Vision.UnsupervisedModels.img_cluster import RoughCluster # (1) UnsupervisedModels contains a Python file named img_cluster.py that contains the RoughCluster class. This is where all the necessary methods for computing the clusters. Note This computation is done with the help of SciKit-Learn and Pandas. Now, create an instance of the RoughCluster class: clusterer = RoughCluster ( \"PATH/TO/CONFIG.json\" ) # (1) More information about the config file is located here: Setup Config File Finally, we can compute the cluster: n_of_clusters = 3 img_location = \"Data/test.jpg\" img_size = ( 200 , 200 ) masked_img_dir = \"Data/Clusters\" masked_img_locations = clusterer . unsupervised_clusters ( n_of_clusters , img_location , img_size , masked_img_dir ) Here is what masked_img_locations should look like: [ \"Data/Clusters/masked0.jpg\" , \"Data/Clusters/masked1.jpg\" , \"Data/Clusters/masked2.jpg\" ] # (1) The amount of images listed depends on the n_of_clusters . These images are the final masked results. Through the config file, you can enable verbose to see the intermediate stage before it individually exporting the images.

It can be imported like so: from MAGIST.Vision.UnsupervisedModels.img_cluster import RoughCluster # (1) UnsupervisedModels contains a Python file named img_cluster.py that contains the RoughCluster class. This is where all the necessary methods for computing the clusters. Note This computation is done with the help of SciKit-Learn and Pandas. Now, create an instance of the RoughCluster class: clusterer = RoughCluster ( \"PATH/TO/CONFIG.json\" ) # (1) More information about the config file is located here: Setup Config File Finally, we can compute the cluster: n_of_clusters = 3 img_location = \"Data/test.jpg\" img_size = ( 200 , 200 ) masked_img_dir = \"Data/Clusters\" masked_img_locations = clusterer . unsupervised_clusters ( n_of_clusters , img_location , img_size , masked_img_dir ) Here is what masked_img_locations should look like: [ \"Data/Clusters/masked0.jpg\" , \"Data/Clusters/masked1.jpg\" , \"Data/Clusters/masked2.jpg\" ] # (1) The amount of images listed depends on the n_of_clusters . These images are the final masked results. Through the config file, you can enable verbose to see the intermediate stage before it individually exporting the images. These images were acquired from WikiPedia . \u21a9 \u21a9","title":"Implementation Using MAGIST"},{"location":"MAGIST%20Vision/3%20-%20Detection%20Data%20Management/","text":"Detection Data Management
