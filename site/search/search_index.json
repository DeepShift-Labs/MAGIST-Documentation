Official Documentation We now have official documentation available here ! Working Principle Please click here to view the full size image: Link Data The data is the most crucial element as the entire intelligence works around it. That is why the AI needs to process it and provide reasonable assumptions. There is another condition, however: the algorithm, in its finished state, MUST be strictly Python code. This means no pre-trained models or presets. It must find its data and process it unsupervised. Although this architecture seems hard-coded in the present state, as more functionality is added, it will be more intelligent and decisive. Here, the data will assume the following structure: Object -> Common Associated Verbs, Synonyms, Events, Timestamps of usage, Nearby Objects, etc. This is the \"Who, What, When, Where, Why, How\" of the data. This data can later be filtered and called upon when inferences are needed. To get here, however, the data must first be extracted from a single image. Since no pre-trained models are allowed, here is the process to follow: 1. K-Means Clustering(find key objects in the image) -> Discriminator for integrity check(see if clustering was performed well) 2. Reverse Image Search and Google Scraping(find the label of image) -> Data Downloader(find dataset from large datasets) 3. Transfer Learn Model -> Object Detector 4. Get a summary from internet sources like Wikipedia; location from LiDAR(future); user from facial detection(future); etc. 5. Store all the data in the NeuralDB Natural Language Processing Another key stage of this AGI(Artificial General Intelligence) is human interaction and understanding. MAGIST will constantly listen to conversations and make intelligent decisions. Here is the target process: 1. Record audio data and transcribe it(this is ***the only*** place where a pre-trained model(the transcriber) is used since learning a human language fully unsupervised is incredibly arduous. 2. Use a custom positional embedding with a Self-Attention head to find keywords. 3. Search these terms in the NeuralDB for possible entries. 4. Search unknown terms online and store definitions for future reference. (future) 5. Extract key terms from matching entries. (future) 6. Insert those key terms into a text transformer trained on the collected NeuralDB data to generate a prediction. (future) 7. Utter the prediction. (future) Usage This project is still under development. Please contact me at krishna.shah@deepshift.dev if you want immediate access and/or support to MAGIST. Once the algorithm is in a stable state, I will release a Python Package on PyPI and Github for access. There will also be documentation with more instructions. Installation This project has many dependencies. Most can be installed using pip . Some require OS-level package managers. This is going to work best in Linux-based systems. These instructions are for Linux-based systems. In particular for Ubuntu 20.04 LTS based operating systems. Other systems may have errors that will require debugging. Linux (Ubuntu-based Systems) First, install Python 3 and pip : sudo apt install python3 python3-dev python3-pip Next, we need to install Firefox and its corresponding geckodriver for headless Selenium searches: sudo apt install firefox Note: If you get an error regarding the geckodriver, you can install it manually by following the instructions here .

MCS is a modular method for managing data-flows and MAGIST subcomponents. For example, for the dataflow \"images\", we have the \"MAGIST Vision\" which contains the \"DetectionDataManager\", \"FullySupervisedModels\", and \"SemiSupervisedModels\". Although all subcomponents do not require configuration, having such categorization provides the modularity that makes MAGIST community-friendly. If community members are interested in making custom modules using the base MAGIST API, they can readily do that through this configuration and a consistent module setup that will be discussed in later wiki pages.

This can contain subsets by authentication method or API provider. This is primarily meant for system-level commands with elevated privileges. 3rd party modules will rarely use this subcomponent. This subcomponent manages all the tasks, threads, cores, and other system resources for faster and more distributed operation. These are global paths for MAGIST core system. 3rd parties will NOT use this subcomponent and will define paths in their own module as the \"tf_lite_detector\" module did. This component manages verbose and debug. 3rd parties will likely use this as a global verbose setting for their subcomponents. This is our first actual subcomponent. This is what 3rd parties will be creating and implementing into the existing MAGIST system. This can contain other elements regarding their module like paths, modes, parameters, etc. This is another example of a subcomponent of MAGIST implemented into the configuration.

Note Please note that this config.json is a sample and the exact parameters vary based on the environment. Other Important Configuration Files The file explored in the previous section is the config.json file under the src/config folder on our repository. There are other files that pertain to this project that must also be explored: - config * config.json * queries.json * schema.json * schema_nested.json Note schema_nested.json is an experimental file that used ElasticSearch nested databases. This file should be ignored. This wiki will only cover schema.json and queries.json since they are relevant to the project. Queries Configuration After the deprecation of MongoDB, MAGIST uses ElasticSearch to perform data storage, management, and querying. This is a drastic change from the first stable release (v0.1.0) which used a completely custom nested querying method. Due to the high-performance search functions the ElasticSearch API exposes, MAGIST transitioned to using them. ElasticSearch entirely runs on JSON queries which is why we created separate configuration files for them. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 { \"object_exists\" : { // (1) \"query\" : { \"query_string\" : { \"query\" : \"\" , \"fields\" : [ \"name\" ], // (2) \"analyzer\" : \"keyword\" // (3) } } }, \"object_full\" : { // (4) \"query\" : { \"multi_match\" : { \"query\" : \"\" , // (5) \"analyzer\" : \"main_analyzer\" // (6) } } }, \"word_exists\" : { // (7) \"query\" : { \"query_string\" : { \"query\" : \"\" , \"fields\" : [ \"name\" ], \"analyzer\" : \"keyword\" } } }, \"word_full\" : { // (8) \"query\" : { \"multi_match\" : { \"query\" : \"\" , \"analyzer\" : \"main_analyzer\" } } } } Query to check if an object exists given a keyword. This does a more narrow search as opposed to the full database search that the following query does. Sets the fields to search through to \"name\" which is just the object name. Runs a keyword search which is meant for names. Query to do a complete database search for objects by any datapoint: name, description, location, usage, etc. Sets the field to wildcard. Uses a custom analyzer to effectively search the database for information. Functions identically to object_exists , but for words. Functions identically to object_full , but for words. These queries can be modified to suit user preferences. Warning MAGIST will simply use the JSON dictionary contained in the categories ( object_exists , object_full , word_exists , word_full ) EXACTLY as they are written here. This means that these dictionaries are fed DIRECTLY into ElasticSearch. Please use ElasticSearch configuration style, keywords, and arguments when modifying. Data Schema Configuration The schema.json file is responsible for defining search parameters, ElasticSearch settings, and the database schema. The schema will structure the data in a logical, easy to search format that can easily be expanded. Adding new modules or datatypes will require extensive modification of this schema. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 { \"object_db_schema\" : { // (1) \"settings\" : { // (2) \"analysis\" : { // (3) \"analyzer\" : { \"main_analyzer\" : { // (4) \"type\" : \"fingerprint\" , // (5) \"stopwords\" : \"_english_\" // (6) } } }, \"similarity\" : { // (7) \"main_similarity\" : { \"type\" : \"LMJelinekMercer\" , // (8) \"lambda\" : 0.5 // (9) } } }, \"mappings\" : { // (10) \"properties\" : { // (11) \"name\" : { \"type\" : \"keyword\" }, // (12) \"description\" : { \"type\" : \"text\" }, // (13) \"users\" : { \"type\" : \"text\" }, // (14) \"related_objects\" : { \"type\" : \"text\" }, // (15) \"location\" : { \"type\" : \"text\" } // (16) } } }, \"word_db_schema\" : { // (17) \"settings\" : { \"analysis\" : { \"analyzer\" : { \"main_analyzer\" : { \"type\" : \"fingerprint\" , \"stopwords\" : \"_english_\" } } }, \"similarity\" : { \"main_similarity\" : { \"type\" : \"LMJelinekMercer\" , \"lambda\" : 0.5 } } }, \"mappings\" : { \"properties\" : { \"word\" : { \"type\" : \"text\" }, // (18) \"definition\" : { \"type\" : \"text\" }, // (19) \"users\" : { \"type\" : \"text\" }, // (20) \"related_words\" : { \"type\" : \"text\" }, // (21) \"related_objects\" : { \"type\" : \"text\" }, // (22) \"location\" : { \"type\" : \"text\" } // (23) } } } } The container for the object database schema. This is the ElasticSearch database settings that defines the analyzer and search settings. The analyzer is a set of algorithms that define the exact semantics on how a word/sentence/paragraph is to be interpreted, searched, and processed. This defines the custom analyzer that MAGIST uses. The analyzer uses the fingerprint algorithm will \"lowercase, normalize to remove extended characters, sort, deduplicate and concatenate into a single token. If a stop-word list is configured, stop words will also be removed\" 1 . Defines the dictionary to use when deleting stop-words like \"is\", \"the\", \"an\", etc. This defines the similarity algorithm ElasticSearch will used when evaluating the similarity of the query to the data sample. This algorithm will \"attempt to capture important patterns in the text, while leaving out noise\" 2 . The lambda parameter is one of the requirements for the algorithm to function. More about LM Jelinek Mercer lambda parameter This defines the database schema (a.k.a mapping) that the database will use to store each document (this refers to a single datapoint with several attributes). In this case, properties refers to the attributes of the object itself and are not ElasticSearch. Name of the objects Description of the object scraped from online sources. People who have been recognized to be using that object. Other objects that relate to this object. Where the object was found. Same database schema container as the object_db_schema but for words. The word that is being stored. The definition of the word. People who were found to use that word. Other words that relate to this one. Objects that relate to the word. Where the word was used. Warning MAGIST will simply use the JSON dictionary contained in the categories ( object_db_schema , word_db_schema ) EXACTLY as they are written here. This means that these dictionaries are fed DIRECTLY into ElasticSearch. Please use ElasticSearch configuration style, keywords, and arguments when modifying.

This is the ElasticSearch database settings that defines the analyzer and search settings. The analyzer is a set of algorithms that define the exact semantics on how a word/sentence/paragraph is to be interpreted, searched, and processed. This defines the custom analyzer that MAGIST uses. The analyzer uses the fingerprint algorithm will \"lowercase, normalize to remove extended characters, sort, deduplicate and concatenate into a single token. If a stop-word list is configured, stop words will also be removed\" 1 . Defines the dictionary to use when deleting stop-words like \"is\", \"the\", \"an\", etc. This defines the similarity algorithm ElasticSearch will used when evaluating the similarity of the query to the data sample. This algorithm will \"attempt to capture important patterns in the text, while leaving out noise\" 2 . The lambda parameter is one of the requirements for the algorithm to function. More about LM Jelinek Mercer lambda parameter This defines the database schema (a.k.a mapping) that the database will use to store each document (this refers to a single datapoint with several attributes). In this case, properties refers to the attributes of the object itself and are not ElasticSearch. Name of the objects Description of the object scraped from online sources. People who have been recognized to be using that object. Other objects that relate to this object. Where the object was found. Same database schema container as the object_db_schema but for words. The word that is being stored. The definition of the word. People who were found to use that word. Other words that relate to this one. Objects that relate to the word. Where the word was used. Warning MAGIST will simply use the JSON dictionary contained in the categories ( object_db_schema , word_db_schema ) EXACTLY as they are written here.

This class in MAGIST will perform image resizing, integrity verification, and image splitting as depicted by the previous article. This allows the data to be formed and prepared to run the final CNN. Importing Necessary Libraries MAGIST will automatically handle all the dependencies as long as the main DataDetectionManager module is imported: 1 from MAGIST.Vision.DetectionDataManager.image_slicer import ImageSlicer Usage Now, we must initialize the class and begin to use it: 1 slicer = ImageSlicer ( \"path/to/config.json\" ) Resize Image This function allows users to resize all images in a given directory to a standard size. Danger It will overwrite existing images. As of now, it does not support functionality to export the images elsewhere. If someone would like to add this functionality, please visit our GitHub Repository to learn how to create a pull-request and request your modifications to be merged. 1 slicer . resizer (( length , width ), \"path/to/directory/with/images\" ) Important Please note that the first argument is a tuple with the image dimensions. Also note that the images do not have to be a square for this to work. It will expand or shrink image dimensions on demand. Coordinate Computation In order to split each input image into a grid, we must first compute the vertices of the grid itself. This will create an array with all the vertices of the grid boxes that can be used to easily split each image. 1 coordinates = slicer . coordinate_compute (( input_length , input_width ), ( output_length , output_width )) # (1) Both arguments are tuples in this case! Important Although this algorithm has preliminary checks in place to ensure that the computation can succeed, there can be edge-cases that can cause major crashes in the algorithm. To ensure this does not happen, please ensure that the input dimensions divide evenly into the output dimensions. For example, the following input-output pairs will work: (500, 500) --> (50, 50) BUT (500, 500) --> (36, 36) will not. What does the coordinates variable look like and how does it contain the grid information? The coordinate variable that you created will look like this: [[left1, upper1, right1, bottom1], [left1+length_of_output, upper1, right1+length_of_output, bottom1] ...] The important thing to note here is how the upper1 and bottom1 will not be modified until the rightmost part of the image is reached. It will essentially split the images from left to right and top to bottom. That is why it is essential for the output images to divide perfectly into the input images. Image Slicing Now for the best part! We will use the coordinates array that we previously computed to split the images. 1 slicer . crop_segments ( coordinates , \"path/to/input/images\" , \"path/to/base/output/directory\" , \"image_class\" ) The first 2 arguments are quite straight forward. The 3rd argument describes where the base data directory is. The the image class (4th argument) will be appended to the \"base directory\" to make the final output directory. For example: Output directory: /home/robot/Project/Data Image class: Turtles Path to images: /home/robot/Project/Data/Turtles/ This functionality helps format the data in directory in a way TensorFlow can easily interpret. Image Integrity Verification Often times, images directly downloaded from the internet can be corrupt. We can use the integrity verification function to delete corrupt images and ensure that TensorFlow doesn't throw any data errors. 1 slicer . image_integrity_verification ( \"path/to/images\" , \"delete_images_bool\" ) This function provides the option to simply check if images are corrupt and count them or to also delete these images from the dataset. Convert Images to PNG (experimental) This class also allows images to be converted to PNG which allows all images to have an alpha value (RGBA instead of RGB) to further standardize the data.

Most of the configuration for the model is done through the configuration files ( Learn More ). Through a default run configuration in the CNN class, you can train the entire model using 1 command. But, to gain finer control over the exact process, you have the option to individually call each subprocess. That is why this page is split into 2 sections: Basic and Advanced. Basic First, you have to import the MAGIST Lite Detector: 1 from MAGIST.Vision.FullySupervisedModels.MAGIST_Lite_Detector import MAGIST_CNN , MAGIST_CNN_Predictor Warning At this point, you MUST have your configuration regarding the CNN done in the config.json file. If not, the rest of the code will not function correctly. Now, you must initialize the CNN using the following line: 1 cnn = MAGIST_CNN ( \"config/config.json\" ) # (1) Make sure to make the local path match your development environment. The final step is to run it. There are two ways to do this and the latter one is recommended. Execution on main thread (not recommended) 1 cnn () # (1) The MAGIST_CNN class contains an __call__ method that supports directly calling the class.

Pass the cnn class object to the queue daemon along with a name and priority. Please not that cnn does not have parenthesis because we are passing an object and not the return of the function. The daemon will execute the function when the queue permits. Also note that the highest priority is 1, so setting the CNN lower allows the computer to finish more important tasks like image downloading or audio processing first. When your code is finished, remember to join the detached thread with the main thread. Otherwise, the detached threads may continue to run in the background. This method is recommended because you can continue running more prevalent processes in the foreground while off-loading the CPU-intensive CNN to the background.

To solve these two issues, MAGIST uses a Threaded Queuing system. Threaded Queueing System This system is composed of two main components: a priority queue and a worker. The priority queue is responsible for managing task priorities and order. When the task is assigned to the queue, the user is required to provide a queue priority. This priority will be used to order tasks. Then the tasks will be assigned from the queue to the workers in sequential order.
