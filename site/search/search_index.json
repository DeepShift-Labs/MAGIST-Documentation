Official Documentation We now have official documentation available here ! Working Principle Data The data is the most crucial element as the entire intelligence works around it. That is why the AI needs to process it and provide reasonable assumptions. There is another condition, however: the algorithm, in its finished state, MUST be strictly Python code. This means no pre-trained models or presets. It must find its data and process it unsupervised. Although this architecture seems hard-coded in the present state, as more functionality is added, it will be more intelligent and decisive. Here, the data will assume the following structure: Object -> Common Associated Verbs, Synonyms, Events, Timestamps of usage, Nearby Objects, etc. This is the \"Who, What, When, Where, Why, How\" of the data. This data can later be filtered and called upon when inferences are needed. To get here, however, the data must first be extracted from a single image. Since no pre-trained models are allowed, here is the process to follow: 1. K-Means Clustering(find key objects in the image) -> Discriminator for integrity check(see if clustering was performed well) 2. Reverse Image Search and Google Scraping(find the label of image) -> Data Downloader(find dataset from large datasets) 3. Transfer Learn Model -> Object Detector 4. Get a summary from internet sources like Wikipedia; location from LiDAR(future); user from facial detection(future); etc. 5. Store all the data in the NeuralDB Natural Language Processing Another key stage of this AGI(Artificial General Intelligence) is human interaction and understanding. MAGIST will constantly listen to conversations and make intelligent decisions. Here is the target process: 1. Record audio data and transcribe it(this is ***the only*** place where a pre-trained model(the transcriber) is used since learning a human language fully unsupervised is incredibly arduous. 2. Use a custom positional embedding with a Self-Attention head to find keywords. 3. Search these terms in the NeuralDB for possible entries. 4. Search unknown terms online and store definitions for future reference. (future) 5. Extract key terms from matching entries. (future) 6. Insert those key terms into a text transformer trained on the collected NeuralDB data to generate a prediction. (future) 7. Utter the prediction. (future) Usage This project is still under development. Please contact me at krishna.shah@deepshift.dev if you want immediate access and/or support to MAGIST. Once the algorithm is in a stable state, I will release a Python Package on PyPI and Github for access. There will also be documentation with more instructions. Installation This project has many dependencies. Most can be installed using pip . Some require OS-level package managers. This is going to work best in Linux-based systems.

MCS is a modular method for managing data-flows and MAGIST subcomponents. For example, for the dataflow \"images\", we have the \"MAGIST Vision\" which contains the \"DetectionDataManager\", \"FullySupervisedModels\", and \"SemiSupervisedModels\". Although all subcomponents do not require configuration, having such categorization provides the modularity that makes MAGIST community-friendly. If community members are interested in making custom modules using the base MAGIST API, they can readily do that through this configuration and a consistent module setup that will be discussed in later wiki pages.

This can contain subsets by authentication method or API provider. This is primarily meant for system-level commands with elevated privileges. 3rd party modules will rarely use this subcomponent. This subcomponent manages all the tasks, threads, cores, and other system resources for faster and more distributed operation. These are global paths for MAGIST core system. 3rd parties will NOT use this subcomponent and will define paths in their own module as the \"tf_lite_detector\" module did. This component manages verbose and debug. 3rd parties will likely use this as a global verbose setting for their subcomponents. This is our first actual subcomponent. This is what 3rd parties will be creating and implementing into the existing MAGIST system. This can contain other elements regarding their module like paths, modes, parameters, etc. This is another example of a subcomponent of MAGIST implemented into the configuration.

Note Please note that this config.json is a sample and the exact parameters vary based on the environment. Other Important Configuration Files The file explored in the previous section is the config.json file under the src/config folder on our repository. There are other files that pertain to this project that must also be explored: - config * config.json * queries.json * schema.json * schema_nested.json Note schema_nested.json is an experimental file that used ElasticSearch nested databases. This file should be ignored. This wiki will only cover schema.json and queries.json since they are relevant to the project. Queries Configuration After the deprecation of MongoDB, MAGIST uses ElasticSearch to perform data storage, management, and querying. This is a drastic change from the first stable release (v0.1.0) which used a completely custom nested querying method. Due to the high-performance search functions the ElasticSearch API exposes, MAGIST transitioned to using them. ElasticSearch entirely runs on JSON queries which is why we created separate configuration files for them. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 { \"object_exists\" : { // (1) \"query\" : { \"query_string\" : { \"query\" : \"\" , \"fields\" : [ \"name\" ], // (2) \"analyzer\" : \"keyword\" // (3) } } }, \"object_full\" : { // (4) \"query\" : { \"multi_match\" : { \"query\" : \"\" , // (5) \"analyzer\" : \"main_analyzer\" // (6) } } }, \"word_exists\" : { // (7) \"query\" : { \"query_string\" : { \"query\" : \"\" , \"fields\" : [ \"name\" ], \"analyzer\" : \"keyword\" } } }, \"word_full\" : { // (8) \"query\" : { \"multi_match\" : { \"query\" : \"\" , \"analyzer\" : \"main_analyzer\" } } } } Query to check if an object exists given a keyword. This does a more narrow search as opposed to the full database search that the following query does. Sets the fields to search through to \"name\" which is just the object name. Runs a keyword search which is meant for names. Query to do a complete database search for objects by any datapoint: name, description, location, usage, etc. Sets the field to wildcard. Uses a custom analyzer to effectively search the database for information. Functions identically to object_exists , but for words. Functions identically to object_full , but for words. These queries can be modified to suit user preferences. Warning MAGIST will simply use the JSON dictionary contained in the categories ( object_exists , object_full , word_exists , word_full ) EXACTLY as they are written here. This means that these dictionaries are fed DIRECTLY into ElasticSearch. Please use ElasticSearch configuration style, keywords, and arguments when modifying. Data Schema Configuration The schema.json file is responsible for defining search parameters, ElasticSearch settings, and the database schema. The schema will structure the data in a logical, easy to search format that can easily be expanded. Adding new modules or datatypes will require extensive modification of this schema. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 { \"object_db_schema\" : { // (1) \"settings\" : { // (2) \"analysis\" : { // (3) \"analyzer\" : { \"main_analyzer\" : { // (4) \"type\" : \"fingerprint\" , // (5) \"stopwords\" : \"_english_\" // (6) } } }, \"similarity\" : { // (7) \"main_similarity\" : { \"type\" : \"LMJelinekMercer\" , // (8) \"lambda\" : 0.5 // (9) } } }, \"mappings\" : { // (10) \"properties\" : { // (11) \"name\" : { \"type\" : \"keyword\" }, // (12) \"description\" : { \"type\" : \"text\" }, // (13) \"users\" : { \"type\" : \"text\" }, // (14) \"related_objects\" : { \"type\" : \"text\" }, // (15) \"location\" : { \"type\" : \"text\" } // (16) } } }, \"word_db_schema\" : { // (17) \"settings\" : { \"analysis\" : { \"analyzer\" : { \"main_analyzer\" : { \"type\" : \"fingerprint\" , \"stopwords\" : \"_english_\" } } }, \"similarity\" : { \"main_similarity\" : { \"type\" : \"LMJelinekMercer\" , \"lambda\" : 0.5 } } }, \"mappings\" : { \"properties\" : { \"word\" : { \"type\" : \"text\" }, // (18) \"definition\" : { \"type\" : \"text\" }, // (19) \"users\" : { \"type\" : \"text\" }, // (20) \"related_words\" : { \"type\" : \"text\" }, // (21) \"related_objects\" : { \"type\" : \"text\" }, // (22) \"location\" : { \"type\" : \"text\" } // (23) } } } } The container for the object database schema. This is the ElasticSearch database settings that defines the analyzer and search settings. The analyzer is a set of algorithms that define the exact semantics on how a word/sentence/paragraph is to be interpreted, searched, and processed. This defines the custom analyzer that MAGIST uses. The analyzer uses the fingerprint algorithm will \"lowercase, normalize to remove extended characters, sort, deduplicate and concatenate into a single token. If a stop-word list is configured, stop words will also be removed\" 1 . Defines the dictionary to use when deleting stop-words like \"is\", \"the\", \"an\", etc. This defines the similarity algorithm ElasticSearch will used when evaluating the similarity of the query to the data sample. This algorithm will \"attempt to capture important patterns in the text, while leaving out noise\" 2 . The lambda parameter is one of the requirements for the algorithm to function. More about LM Jelinek Mercer lambda parameter This defines the database schema (a.k.a mapping) that the database will use to store each document (this refers to a single datapoint with several attributes). In this case, properties refers to the attributes of the object itself and are not ElasticSearch. Name of the objects Description of the object scraped from online sources. People who have been recognized to be using that object. Other objects that relate to this object. Where the object was found. Same database schema container as the object_db_schema but for words. The word that is being stored. The definition of the word. People who were found to use that word. Other words that relate to this one. Objects that relate to the word. Where the word was used. Warning MAGIST will simply use the JSON dictionary contained in the categories ( object_db_schema , word_db_schema ) EXACTLY as they are written here. This means that these dictionaries are fed DIRECTLY into ElasticSearch. Please use ElasticSearch configuration style, keywords, and arguments when modifying.

The analyzer is a set of algorithms that define the exact semantics on how a word/sentence/paragraph is to be interpreted, searched, and processed. This defines the custom analyzer that MAGIST uses. The analyzer uses the fingerprint algorithm will \"lowercase, normalize to remove extended characters, sort, deduplicate and concatenate into a single token. If a stop-word list is configured, stop words will also be removed\" 1 . Defines the dictionary to use when deleting stop-words like \"is\", \"the\", \"an\", etc. This defines the similarity algorithm ElasticSearch will used when evaluating the similarity of the query to the data sample. This algorithm will \"attempt to capture important patterns in the text, while leaving out noise\" 2 . The lambda parameter is one of the requirements for the algorithm to function. More about LM Jelinek Mercer lambda parameter This defines the database schema (a.k.a mapping) that the database will use to store each document (this refers to a single datapoint with several attributes). In this case, properties refers to the attributes of the object itself and are not ElasticSearch. Name of the objects Description of the object scraped from online sources. People who have been recognized to be using that object. Other objects that relate to this object. Where the object was found. Same database schema container as the object_db_schema but for words. The word that is being stored. The definition of the word. People who were found to use that word. Other words that relate to this one. Objects that relate to the word. Where the word was used. Warning MAGIST will simply use the JSON dictionary contained in the categories ( object_db_schema , word_db_schema ) EXACTLY as they are written here. This means that these dictionaries are fed DIRECTLY into ElasticSearch. Please use ElasticSearch configuration style, keywords, and arguments when modifying.

We are currently in the process of building the MAGIST. As a result, there might be issues or bugs that you encounter. If you encounter any issues, please post an issue on the MAGIST GitHub repository. We will try to resolve them as soon as possible. If you have a solution to the issue, you may create a pull request, and we will review it as soon as possible. With that out of the way, let's get started! How it works? We are using a powerful technique that combine the decades of research our brilliant researchers have done. We are using a multi-agent approach to intelligently process real-world data and learn from it. To understand this, however, it is crucial to comprehend how we define general intelligence, as there are major discrepancies from source to source. Our Goal General intelligence is the ability of a machine to automatically acquire and train itself on a vast variety of knowledge that it may acquire from any source. It must also be able to make new predictions on the data upon inquisition (direct or indirect). This machine may not start with any pre-trained models, data, etc. Setup MAGIST is a complex project, so a clean and efficient work space is essential.

K-Means Clustering aims to divide a given sample data into \"k\" groups. The process is intuitively simple: Place k number centroids of the clusters in random locations in the data space.

It attempts to identify individual objects in an image which can then be further processed to extract more information. For this, you must use the UnsupervisedModels under the Vision directory. It can be imported like so: from MAGIST.Vision.UnsupervisedModels.img_cluster import RoughCluster # (1) UnsupervisedModels contains a Python file named img_cluster.py that contains the RoughCluster class. This is where all the necessary methods for computing the clusters. Note This computation is done with the help of SciKit-Learn and Pandas.
