# Convolutional Neural Networks for Object Detection

To build a CNN using the MAGIST API using the functions provided by MAGIST Vision is extremely complicated. Most of the configuration for the model is done through the configuration files ([Learn More](../../Configuration/1 - Setup Config File.md)). Through a default run configuration in the CNN class, you can train the entire model using 1 command. But, to gain finer control over the exact process, you have the option to individually call each subprocess. That is why this page is split into 2 sections: Basic and Advanced.

## Basic
First, you have to import the MAGIST Lite Detector:

```py linenums=1
from MAGIST.Vision.FullySupervisedModels.MAGIST_Lite_Detector import MAGIST_CNN, MAGIST_CNN_Predictor
```
